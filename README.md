# BashScripts
A random collection of bash scripts that I've developed somewhere along the way for whatever reason. There's no theme other than that they're bash scripts...

### Git Pull All
Scans all local branches in git and, if they're any number of commits behind (and no commits ahead), pulls from remote. If a branch has no upstream also asks the user if they want to delete the branch (useful for delete after merge workflows).
